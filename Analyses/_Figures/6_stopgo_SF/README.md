# Information

The figures GroupAnalysis_unc.pdf and GroupAnalysis_cor.pdf contain the result of
taking 20 subjects from the database, pool them using OLS and then calculate the P-values.
First, we threshold uncorrected for multiple testing at P < 0.001.
Then we control the FDR at level 0.05.

The pdf's are binary images: 0/1 surviving threshold YES/NO.

Only small areas of activation are observed at this sample size.
