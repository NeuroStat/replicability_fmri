# Structure

The files fig_coherence.R, fig_overlap.R and fig_stability.R are used to create
all the figures. 
They also contain measurements used in the text (such as median kappa at N = 30, etc.).

The folder _IllustrationCoherence_ contains R code to generate the illustration of coherence.
The folder _IllustrationOverlap_ contains R code to generate the illustration of overlap (using the Monte-Carlo simulations).

The folders of the contrasts contain figures that are only related to that specific contrast.
