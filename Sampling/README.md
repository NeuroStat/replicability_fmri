# Structure

These scripts are used to sample subjects, calculate the measurements and prepare for preprocessing (run on HPC).

The folders:
* CognitiveTasks
* Faces
* Incentive
* StopGo
contain the used contrasts.

Within these, we have:
* Coherence
* SplitSubjects
* Stability
which correspond to the 3 types of measurements. 
Note however that _SplitSubjects_ corresponds to the test-retest reliability (it was called
differently during research).
