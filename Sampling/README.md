# Structure

The folders:
* Coherence
* SplitSubjects
* Stability
correspond to the 3 types of measurements. 
Note however that _SplitSubjects_ corresponds to the test-retest reliability (it was called
otherwise during research).

The folder MaximiseOverlap contains scripts developing the algorithm to estimate the 
proportion of truly active voxels in an fMRI image. This is based on maximising the overlap
between independent groups of subjects.
