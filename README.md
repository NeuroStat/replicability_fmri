# Measuring the replicability of fMRI results using a large database.

Github project for the paper:
"The empirical replicability of task-based fMRI in function of sample size."

## Introduction

In this project, we investigate the replicability of fMRI results. We measure the latter through the (un)conditional test-retest reliability, coherence and stability of fMRI group studies under increasing sample size. 
We use the a database with N = 1400 subjects from where we subsample independent replications.

## Structure of project
* Sampling: contains the scripts which were used for sampling and generating the results.
* Analyses: contains the scripts to generate the pre-processed data, the analyses and finally the figures for the paper. 

The actual database is separated from this repository due to privacy reasons. Pre-processed (and blinded) *intermediate* R files are saved in /2_Analyses/_IntData. 
To generate the figures, one then only needs this folder and the /2_Analyses/_Figures folder.
