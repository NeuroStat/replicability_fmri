# Measuring the replicability of fMRI results using a large database.

Github project for the paper:
"Measuring reliability, coherence and stability of fMRI results using a large database."

## Introduction

In this project, we investigate the replicability of fMRI results. We measure the latter through the (un)conditional test-retest reliability, coherence and stability of fMRI group studies under increasing sample size. 
We use the *IMAGEN* database from where we subsample tests and independent replications.

## Structure of project
* Sampling: contains the scripts for sampling and generating the raw results.
* Analyses: contains the scripts to generate the pre-processed data, the analyses and finally the figures for the paper. 

The actual *IMAGEN* database is separated from this repository. Furthermore, the **raw** results are too large to save into a Github repository and hence also separated. Pre-processed *intermediate* R files are saved in /2_Analyses/_IntData. 
To generate the figures, one then only needs this folder and the /2_Analyses/_Figures folder.
